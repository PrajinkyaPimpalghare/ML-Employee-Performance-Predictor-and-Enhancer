===================================================================================
Its My Own Idea With Following Logic.

Logic:
>> Who ever work on the computer, most of the actions has been done using Keyboard or mouse.
>> The frequency of keyboard and mouse usage can be utilize for predicting the employee performance as well mindset.
>> Employee performance can be enhanced or monitored by using its keyboard/mouse usage frequency data and providing random messages and monitoring is it affecting employee performance or not.
>> Always next messages will be shown , depending on the basic of reacion to last messages and keyboard/mouse usage data.


It Is Under Development...Its little baby learning...Wait For Full Version
