# ML-Employee-Performance-Predictor-and-Enhancer
Machine Learning Implimentation For Predicting Employees Performance And Enhancing There Performnace By Poping Up Random Messages According To There Performance Graph. 
===================================================================================
Its My Own Idea With Following Logic.

LOGIC:
>> Who ever work on the computer, most of the actions has been done using Keyboard or mouse.
>> The frequency of keyboard and mouse usage can be utilize for predicting the employee performance as well mindset.
>> Employee performance can be enhanced or monitored by using its keyboard/mouse usage frequency data and providing random messages and monitoring is it affecting employee performance or not.
>> Always next messages will be shown , depending on the basic of reacion to last messages and keyboard/mouse usage data.

BACKEND:
>> Python 3
>> Pandas
>> Scikit Learn
>> Msg Pack [For fast dataloading and uploading]

IMPLIMENTATION:

>> Every Minute data is getting collected : [Total keys pressed/released count, Which keys are pressed/Released , Mouse moved cound and its coordinate]
>> Total count of all the process has been saved and loaded using "msg-pack" and "Pandas module".
>> Data has been saved in "EmployeeData.msg" with respective everyminute.
>> Implimentation of "Prediction of performance" is under development.... 


It Is Under Development...Its little baby learning...Wait For Full Version
